Water Quality Prediction For Concrete Mixing 
Traditionally, water quality assessment for concrete mixtures has relied on laboratory 
testing, which can be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly. With 
advancements in machine learning and data-driven approaches, predictive models can 
offer a faster, more efficient alternative for evaluating water quality. This study aims 
to develop and implement machine learning models to classify water quality based on 
key physicochemical properties, providing a reliable method for assessing its 
suitability for concrete production. 
The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature 
selection, and the application of various classification models, including Logistic 
Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors 
(KNN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The models are trained and tested on 
real-world water quality data to predict whether a given water sample is suitable for 
concrete mixing. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
score are used to evaluate model effectiveness. 
By integrating artificial intelligence into water quality assessment, this study provides 
a data-driven approach to ensuring optimal concrete performance. The findings of this 
research can help engineers, construction companies, and quality control professionals 
make informed decisions, reducing risks associated with poor-quality water in 
construction projects. This report presents a detailed analysis of the methodology, 
results, and implications of using machine learning for water quality prediction in 
concrete mixtures.
